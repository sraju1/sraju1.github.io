<p> 
    I am currently pursuing my PhD in Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. Prior to this, I was a research technician at UCSF, 
    working at the interface of genetics, immunology, and systems biology. Under the joint supervision of Drs. Alexander Marson, Jimmie Ye, 
    and Matt Spitzer, I worked on projects related to understanding how immune cell proportions, profiles, and fates are shifted 
    in various disease states.

<p>
    I graduated <i> summa cum laude </i> from Emory University in 2016, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Physics. I was born in New Jersey 
    but have lived in Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Georgia, and Wisconsin. I am always thinking about ways to push forward 
    breakthroughs in cancer immunology, gene therapy, and cell engineering. I thrive in the world of academia, but am always open to 
    outside opportunities that allow me to make a larger impact in pushing forward such breakthroughs.
