## About Me

I understand disease to be an emergent property arising from the byzantine hierarchies of life; I thus seek to discover the general rules of scale dependence that underlie order in complex living systems. I currently focus on the immune system from the perspective of network dynamics in genetic circuits, tumor microenvironments, and autoimmune diseases. 

I am currently pursuing my PhD in Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. Prior to this, I was a research technician at UCSF, working at the interface of genetics, immunology, and systems biology. Under the joint supervision of Drs. [Alexander Marson](https://marsonlab.ucsf.edu/), [Jimmie Ye](https://bms.ucsf.edu/people/jimmie-ye-phd), and [Matt Spitzer](https://spitzerlab.ucsf.edu/home), I worked on projects related to understanding how immune cell proportions, profiles, and fates are shifted in various disease states. 

I graduated *summa cum laude* from Emory University in 2016, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Physics. I was born in New Jersey but have lived in Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Georgia, and Wisconsin. I am always thinking about ways to push forward breakthroughs in cancer immunology, gene therapy, and cell engineering. I thrive in the world of academia, but am always open to outside opportunities that allow me to make a larger impact in pushing forward such breakthroughs.
