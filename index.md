## About Me

I am a physicist by training, a data scientist and biologist by trade, and a philosopher by nature. I seek to discover the general rules of scale dependence that underlie order in complex living systems.

I am currently a research technician at UCSF, working at the interface of genetics, immunology, and systems biology. Under the joint supervision of Drs. Alexander Marson, Jimmie Ye, and Matt Spitzer, I am determining how immune cell proportions, profiles, and fates are shifted in various disease states. 

I will be joining Harvard's Systems Biology PhD Program this coming Fall. I graduated summa cum laude from Emory University in 2016, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Physics.
