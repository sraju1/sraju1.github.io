## About Me

I am a physicist by training, a data scientist and biologist by trade, and a philosopher by nature. I seek to discover the general rules of scale dependence that underlie order in complex living systems.

I am currently a research technician at UCSF, working at the interface of genetics, immunology, and systems biology. Under the joint supervision of Drs. [Alexander Marson](https://marsonlab.ucsf.edu/), [Jimmie Ye](https://bms.ucsf.edu/people/jimmie-ye-phd), and [Matt Spitzer](https://spitzerlab.ucsf.edu/home), I am determining how immune cell proportions, profiles, and fates are shifted in various disease states. 

I will be joining Harvard's Systems Biology PhD Program this coming Fall. I graduated *summa cum laude* from Emory University in 2016, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Physics.
